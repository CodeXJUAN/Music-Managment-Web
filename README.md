# Music Managment Web

A class project, that its purpose is to made a managment website.

## Languages

In this website I used HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and Python for the backend.

## Backend

In the backend use Python, because you also had to use Flask to make the connection with the database.

## Database

For the database we have been made to use MongoDB, because we are on the subject of Non-Relational Database, and one of the most popular was MongoDB.
